After subscribing, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **`Poly-Glot: Configure License Token`** to activate instantly.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started in 60 Seconds

1. **Install** Poly-Glot from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poly-glot-ai.poly-glot)
2. **Add your API key** → Command Palette → `Poly-Glot: Configure API Key`
   - Choose **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, or **Google** as your provider
   - Pick your preferred model (we recommend `gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, or `gemini-2.5-flash`) — or enter any custom model ID
   - Paste your API key (stored securely in the OS keychain — never in `settings.json`)
3. **Select any function or block of code** in the editor
4. **Press `Cmd+Shift+/`** (`Ctrl+Shift+/` on Windows/Linux) → comments appear inline instantly

That's it. No backend, no account required for the Free tier, no telemetry.

---

## 🛠 Features

### 📝 Generate AI Comments — `Cmd+Shift+/` / `Ctrl+Shift+/` (Free)

Select code (or leave nothing selected for the whole file) and Poly-Glot writes perfectly formatted, language-native documentation comments and inserts them directly into your file.

**What gets generated:**
- Function/method summaries in plain English
- `@param` / `@returns` / `@throws` tags (JSDoc, Javadoc, KDoc…)
- Type annotations where applicable
- Edge-case and exception notes
- Language-appropriate formatting — always

No more manually writing boilerplate Javadoc or hunting for the correct JSDoc syntax.

---

### 💡 Why-Comments — `Cmd+Shift+W` / `Ctrl+Shift+W` (Pro)

AI inserts **inline comments that explain *why* the code exists** — not just what it does.

Captures:
- Trade-offs and design decisions
- Non-obvious algorithmic choices
- Performance or security considerations
- Historical context that would otherwise live only in a developer's head

Why-Comments give AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) the context they need to give *you* better suggestions. They make PRs self-reviewing and onboarding dramatically faster.

---

### 🔀 Both Mode — `Cmd+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Pro)

Generates **doc-comments AND why-comments in a single API call**. One shortcut, full documentation coverage. Use this on any function you want fully documented before a code review.

---

### 🔍 Explain Code — `Cmd+Shift+E` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Free)

Select any code and open a rich side panel that shows:

| Analysis | Detail |
|---|---|
| 📖 Plain-English summary | What this code does, for any audience |
| 📊 Complexity score (1–10) | Cyclomatic complexity with visual indicator |
| 🔬 Function/method breakdown | Params, return types, side effects |
| 🐛 Potential bugs | Issues the AI detected |
| 💡 Improvement suggestions | Refactoring and optimization ideas |
| 📈 Documentation quality score | 0–100 rating of existing comments |

---

### 📚 Templates Sidebar (Free)

Browse a curated library of comment templates for all 12 supported languages. One-click copy to clipboard for:
- Class/module headers
- Function doc-comment skeletons
- License headers
- TODO / FIXME / HACK / DEPRECATED blocks
- API endpoint documentation stubs

---

### 💰 Real-Time Cost Tracking (Free)

Every generation displays the **exact token cost in the status bar**. A typical function documentation costs **< $0.001**. Document an entire file for pennies.

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

> **Prerequisite:** The **Poly-Glot VS Code Extension** must be installed and configured with an API key before using Poly-Glot in Copilot Chat. Requires **VS Code v1.95+** and an active **GitHub Copilot** subscription.

Poly-Glot registers itself as a **Copilot Chat participant** (`@poly-glot`), so you can generate comments, explain code, and get documentation analysis directly inside the Copilot Chat panel — no switching tabs, no copy-paste.

### 🔧 Setup (3 steps)

1. **Install the Poly-Glot extension** from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poly-glot-ai.poly-glot)
2. **Configure your API key** → Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) → `Poly-Glot: Configure API Key` → choose provider, paste key, pick model
3. **Open Copilot Chat** → `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) → type `@poly-glot` to activate

That's it. No extra config. The participant is registered automatically when the extension is active.

---

### 💬 Commands

| Command | What it does | Plan |
|---|---|:---:|
| `@poly-glot /comment` | Generate doc-comments for selected code | Free |
| `@poly-glot /explain` | Deep code analysis — complexity, bugs, doc quality | Free |
| `@poly-glot /why` | Add WHY-comments explaining intent & trade-offs | **Pro** |
| `@poly-glot /both` | Doc-comments + WHY-comments in one pass | **Pro** |

---

### 🗣 Prompt Examples

**Generate doc-comments for a function:**
```
@poly-glot /comment
```
> Select the function in the editor first, then send the command. Poly-Glot generates JSDoc, Javadoc, PyDoc, etc. and shows an **Apply to Editor** button to insert inline.

---

**Explain what a block of code does:**
```
@poly-glot /explain
```
> Returns a plain-English summary, complexity score (1–10), function-by-function breakdown, potential bugs, refactoring suggestions, and a documentation quality score (0–100).

---

**Add WHY-comments to explain decisions (Pro):**
```
@poly-glot /why
```
> Inserts inline comments explaining *why* the code is written the way it is — trade-offs, algorithm choices, business constraints. Makes PRs self-reviewing and helps Copilot give you better suggestions.

---

**Document everything in one shot (Pro):**
```
@poly-glot /both
```
> Runs two passes — first generates doc-comments, then adds WHY-comments — and delivers both in a single response with an **Apply to Editor** button.

---

**Ask a follow-up question after `/explain`:**
```
@poly-glot /explain
Why is the time complexity O(n²) here? Can it be improved?
```
> Poly-Glot uses the same AI context window as your configured model, so you can follow up with natural language questions after any command.

---

### ❓ Copilot Chat FAQ

**Does `@poly-glot` use my API key?**
Yes — Poly-Glot uses whichever OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google key you configured in the extension. GitHub Copilot and Poly-Glot are completely separate; Poly-Glot does not use your Copilot subscription's token budget.

**Why doesn't `@poly-glot` appear in chat?**
The participant only registers if the extension is active and VS Code v1.95+ is installed. Try: Command Palette → `Developer: Reload Window`.

**Can I use `/why` and `/both` without Pro?**
No — WHY-comments and Both mode are Pro features. [Upgrade at poly-glot.ai](https://poly-glot.ai/#pg-pricing-section) — use code **`EARLYBIRD3`** at checkout to lock Pro at **$9/mo forever** (expires May 1, 2026).

**Does it work with VS Code Insiders?**
Yes — any VS Code build ≥ 1.95 with Copilot Chat enabled works.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Your code and API keys are **100% private**:

- 🔑 **API keys stored in OS keychain** — VS Code `SecretStorage` (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux `libsecret`). Never written to `settings.json` or any log file.
- 📡 **Direct API calls only** — requests go from your machine straight to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. Poly-Glot has no backend server, no relay, no proxy.
- 🚫 **Zero telemetry** — no usage data, no error reporting, no analytics are ever collected.
- 🏠 **Your code never touches our servers** — because we don't have any.

**OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google** may use API request data per their own privacy policies. If you're working with sensitive code, check your provider's data-handling settings (all three offer zero-data-retention options for API users).

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Do I need a Poly-Glot account?**
No account is required for the Free tier. Just bring your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API key.

**Does Poly-Glot work offline?**
No — it needs to reach the OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API. But no other internet connection is required.

**Can I switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google?**
Yes — switch providers any time via `Poly-Glot: Configure API Key`. Only one provider is active at a time.

**Do I need a paid Google account?**
No — Google AI Studio API keys are free to create at [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Free-tier rate limits apply; enabling billing in Google Cloud unlocks higher quotas.

**Will comments be inserted into my file or shown in a panel?**
By default, comments are inserted **inline** at the correct position in your file. Set `polyglot.insertInline: false` to open a diff panel instead.

**What if I select nothing?**
Poly-Glot documents the **entire active file** — great for batch documentation.

**Is there a team or enterprise plan?**
Email [support@poly-glot.ai](mailto:support@poly-glot.ai) for team licensing.
